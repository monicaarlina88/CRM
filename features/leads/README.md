## Leads status flow :&#x20;

* When `New` leads appear on the list, sales will approach them and it will change the status to `In Process`.
  * If the leads decided to register and create a demo account then the status will change to `Qualified`
  * If not then the status change to `Failed`.
* Once the leads already try their demo account and decided to create a live account, they will have to fill out a due diligence document and submit it to our system. The status will updated to `Converted` in Leads menu and a new account will appear in Accounts menu.
* When the leads deposit money to their live account, system will update the status of leads to `Funded` in the list.
