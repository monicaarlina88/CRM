# Import New Leads

To import new leads, you can click `Import` button. If you already have the import file ready, you can click `Choose File` , pick your leads data, and click Submit. If you don't have the template, you can download the template by clicking the `template.xlsx` file.

If you input any duplicated data, you will be notified which data is duplicated from the file you have imported.
